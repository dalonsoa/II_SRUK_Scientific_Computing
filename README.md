# II_SRUK_Scientific_Computing
This repository contains the material for the II edition of the SRUK Scientific Computing. All the sections covered in this workshop are introduced below

## R and Python: get yourself started!
We are going to learn how to program in R and Python, so you need to first download this software before attending the workshop.   

   * [Installing R](https://github.com/dalonsoa/scientific_computing/blob/master/installing_R.md)   
   * [Installing Python](https://github.com/dalonsoa/scientific_computing/blob/master/installing_python.md)

## Windows users: the shell terminal
If you are a Mac or an Ubuntu user, you will already have access to the terminal. However, if you are a Windows user, we recommend you to follow the instructions given in the next link so you can easily follow the Bash session of the workshop:

## Good programming practice

And least, but not last, a piece of advice for your programming practice! As newcomers to the programming world, it is easier for you to start applying from your very first code a good programming practice as you do not have to remove bad programming habits. Therefore, we encourage you to read some tips we have learnt through our experience which have improved the quality of our coding and saved many hours of debugging. We hope you take your time to go through them and follow them from the very beginning. You will see that they are easy to understand, easy to remember, and easy to apply to your coding style :smile:
