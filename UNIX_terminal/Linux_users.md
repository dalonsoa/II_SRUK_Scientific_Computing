# Terminal in Linux distributions 

If you are a Linux user, you already have an easy access to the terminal
from which you can run UNIX/Linux commands. However, maybe 
you have never used it and you do not really know how to find it. Even the screenshots below show the steps you need to follow to find the terminal with interface from the Ubuntu 18.04 version, the same procedure applies to any other Ubuntu version or
Linux distribution. Just bear in mind that some of the buttons might be in a different place or 
the desktop interface might look differently, but the procedure to find and pin the terminal is very similar :smile:

Click the `Activities` button from the main menu and a search box will pop up
in the middle of your desktop. Then, start typing `terminal` there and you will see that immediately 
the terminal icon appears. If you click this icon, a terminal will open on
your desktop. Also, you will see that the terminal icon appears now in your tasks bar.
Right-click this icon and then select 
`Add to Favourites` to pin the terminal icon in your tasks bar. This will make your life easier to 
launch a terminal because you will not need to repeat the previous steps every single time you log in your session!
From now onwards, just click the terminal icon and start coding!
