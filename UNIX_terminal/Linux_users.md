# Terminal in Linux distributions 

If you are a Linux user, you already have an easy access to the terminal
from which you can run UNIX/Linux commands. However, maybe 
you have never used it and you do not really know how to find it. Even though the Ubuntu 18.04 version is used to explain 
the following steps, and maybe some of the buttons might be in a different place or 
the desktop interface might look differently, the same procedure applies to any other Ubuntu version or
Linux distribution :smile:

Click the `Activities` button from the main menu and a search box will pop up 
in the middle of your desktop. Start typing `terminal` and you will see that immediately 
the terminal icon appears. If you click this icon, then a Terminal will open on
your desktop and you will see that in your tasks bar 
the icon is also there. Right-click this icon on the tasks bar and select 
`Add to Favourites`. This will pin the Terminal icon in your tasks bar so you 
you will not need to do the previous steps every single time you log in your session!
