# Terminal in Mac OS 

If you are a Mac OS user, you can launch a terminal
from which you can run UNIX/Linux commands. In general, most of the OS have the
bash terminal installed. You have an easy access to the terminal, but maybe 
you have never used this. 

Inside the `Applications` directory, you will find the `Utilities` directory. 
Go inside the latter and you will see one executable called `Terminal`. Double 
click and you will immediately launch the terminal!
